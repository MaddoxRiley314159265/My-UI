# My-UI

A highly customizable user interface api that I made because I was tired of figuring out how to use tkinter.

The UI consists of a list of menus, with an index for the current menu displayed /////TODO: or an order of which to display them

Menus have a rectangle where they are, a background, a transition for switching to and from this menu, and a list of menu elements

Menu elements are updated each frame with input data to change their appearance
